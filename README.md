gossip
======

A PJSIP-based SIP client library written in ObjC using a bit more object-oriented approach.

Also contains configured sources of the open source [PJSIP](http://www.pjsip.org/) library.

### Building

Before Gossip will builds, you must do one of the following.

* Run the `pjsip/build-pjsip` command in the terminal after you've checked out the code or...
* Copy the file `pjsip/config_site.h` to `pjlib/include/pj/config_site.h` as this is required by PJSIP.
